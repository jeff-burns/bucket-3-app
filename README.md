## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

## [DEMO](https://youtu.be/3b8NMjVOzZw)

### Pimp My (Bike) Ride
* This is a Full Stack App that will allow the user to find the weather conditions (chance of precipitation, temp, windchill, cloudiness) at the beginning and end of a proposed route. 

* The user inputs the city, state and zipcode for the beginning and end of the route, as well as, a rough estimate of the times that they will begin and end the route. 

* If the user so chooses, they can enter their name and their beginning and end locations will be saved. In order to access these saved locations later, they can enter their name again and check the box directly below the user name input- the information will be autofilled. If they want to alter those autofilled values, the app will then save that new, altered set of locations for the next time.

* Stretch Goals:
    * Integration with an alarm, to let the user know up to about 12 hours before the proposed ride, what the conditions will be for the route.
    * Sleeker user interface, with more options for their data.
    * Adding a functional map to choose the route.
    * Allowing more than 2 locations to be input.

### Technologies
* React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootswatch, Node.js, Express.js, Knex.js, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Moment.js.
